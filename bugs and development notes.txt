//REMINDER OF WHAT’S DONE:

bugs and ideas:
- Make dink sequence checks customisable
- remove redundant procedures from all scripts
- remove freedink 1084 stuff

TUTNOTES:
- Mention somewhere that if depth dot is outside hardbox, Hardbox values MUST be passed.
- Escape.c - help section and settings.

- "push_active(0);" option in "onload.c"

- “pushdelay” is now true to wait time. If hybrid system is active anything above 450 has possibility of causing issues.

- moveactive now returns sprite number of sprite being moved.

- move_after_idle custom key, ignores movedetectafter procedure if sprite didn’t move, and enables the additional IdleDetectAfter procedure
- move_during_idle custom key, ignores movedetectduring procedure if sprite didn’t move, and enables the additional IdleDetectDuring procedure
- move_idle custom key, is the equivelant to setting “move_after_idle” and “move_during_idle” to 1

//////////////////////
//Config custom keys//
//////////////////////
The below sp_custom() keys are used to configure/customise push and pull on a sprite, setting these to certain values, as described below will change the way push and pull will work with them.
Example use: sp_custom(“move_nohard”, &current_sprite, 1); will make &current_sprite ignore hardness when being moved.

 "push": Used to make push and pull run the normal push() prcedure. Basically, this mimicks vanilla push system when enabled on a sprite, except with no delay before push activates, by default.
         0 = push() procedure will not be enabled
         1 = push() procedure will be enabled - the push/pull system will look into the sprite script and run push(), rather than using the push/pull system
         Higher than 1: Will use the value as a delay before push() activates (so it’s not instant when Dink touches the sprite). Alternatively, you can set a separate “pushdelay” custom key.

------------------------------------------

“push_custom”: Used to enable the “push_custom” procedure, instead of using the push/pull system. When enabled, it will even skip playing the push sequence.
               0 = push_custom() procedure will not be enabled
	       1 = push_custom() procedure will be enabled - the push/pull system will look into the sprite script and run push_custom(), rather than using the push/pull system (won’t even play a push sequence)
               Higher than 1: Will use the value as a delay before push_custom() activates (so it’s not instant when Dink touches the sprite). Alternatively, you can set a separate “pushdelay” custom key.

------------------------------------------

"move_nohard": Used to let the sprite move through hardness when moving it. With this active, the sprite will ignore hardness when being moved.
	       0 = Will not move through hardness
	       1 = Will move through hardness

------------------------------------------

"pushdelay": Used to set a “wait()” delay before push activates, when walking into a sprite. Set the value to the desired delay (in millseconds)

------------------------------------------

"stopmove": Used to halt a sprite immediately, when it is being moved. Dink will not release the sprite, it will simply act as if it cannot move in any direction while this is active.
            Basically, it will act the same as when it is stopped by hardness. Dink will also say the default say line for a sprite unable to move any further (found in "dsmove.c" - "limit" procedure.).
	    0 = Sprite is free to move
	    1 = Sprite will halt movement

------------------------------------------

"base_walk": Used to tell the push/pull system Dink is currently using a different base_walk sequence than his default. This needs to be set if Dinks base walk is different.

“base_push”: Used to tell the push/pull system Dink is currently using a different base_push sequence than his default. This needs to be set if Dinks base push is different.

“base_idle”: Used to tell the push/pull system Dink is currently using a different base_idle sequence than his default. This needs to be set if Dinks base idle is different.

Alternatively, set the above “base” custom keys on Dink, rather than every sprite. If set on a sprite though, they will take priority over Dinks custom key setting.

------------------------------------------

“pull_depthdot_adjust”: Used to adjust the point at which Dink will collide with hardness when pulling. By default, it is set to the back of Dinks feet.
                        If you change Dinks base push using the “base_push” custom key, you have this as an option to fine tune it.

------------------------------------------

"setcollision":  Used to set whether hardbox collision should be enabled for a sprite when moving it. If enabled, the sprite will stop when it's hardbox hits a sprite, rather than it's depth dot.
	          1(or higher) = Collision enabled.

 			"trimleft": see below
 			"trimtop" : see below
 			"trimright": see below
 			"trimbottom": see below
  
     			The above trim custom keys are used to trim a certain amount of pixels from the designated hardbox side when calculating collision only.
     			This is useful to allow the sprites to move a bit closer to other sprites, rather than stopping precisely when the hardbox edge meets hardness.
     			e.g, if you set "trimleft" to 10,  it'll act as if 10 pixels are trimmed off the left harbox edge when calculating collision with other hardness, in all directions.
          	     	    i.e, the sprite will literally behave as if the hardbox is 10 pixels shorter on the left side, while the sprite is being moved.

------------------------------------------

"Enable-Limit": Used to enable the X/Y, Min/Max override custom keys. This will make it so the sprite cannot exceed these set X/Y limit values.
		You cannot use this to override detected hard limits - use the custom key “move_nohard” to make a sprite ignore hardness when being moved.
		0 = Disabled
		1 = Enabled
 		2 = Enabled, and IGNORE values of 0 or -1 in Push and Pull Calculations.

"setXmax": The maximum X value the sprite cannot pass, when "Enable-Limit" is enabled.

"setXmin": The minimum X value the sprite cannot pass, when "Enable-Limit" is enabled.

"setYmax": The maximum Y value the sprite cannot pass, when "Enable-Limit" is enabled.

"setYmin": The minimum Y value the sprite cannot pass, when "Enable-Limit" is enabled.

- These limits are STRICTLY and PRECISELY enforced as the min/max X and Y position the sprite is allowed to achieve. It's like a hard boundary which will not be breached even by 1 pixel, even with sprite timing issues.
  The X/Y conditions are checked constantly when the sprite is moved in the direction related to a particular limit, and then enforced.
  If you set a limit to a value that the sprite has already breached, the next time it is pushed in the direction of that limit, it will instantly snap back to it's limit so it's not in breach of it.
  SO avoid setting limits that have already been breached by the sprite. Or use the "stopmove" custom key instead if you want to achieve an exceeded limit where the sprite simply can't be moved anymore.

- If you need to set a value to "-1" (which can't be done in a custom key, because "-1" retrieves the custom keys value), set it to "-1111" and push and pull will interpret it as "-1" instead.

- A value of "9999" will cause an individual key to be ignored when “Enable-Limit” is higher than 0. (e.g, you might want to set the "setXmax" value only. You would then set all the others to "9999" so they are ignored).
  OR ALTERNATIVELY - when “Enable-Limit” is ‘2’ any custom key value of ’0’ or ‘-1’ will be ignored. So you can use this setting, set the keys you want, leave the others untouched.

	    Returns 2, 4, 6, or 8

------------------------------------------

"dinkoy": Returns Dinks Y position at the time he grabbed the sprite (but before he moved it).

------------------------------------------

"spriteox": Returns a sprites X position at the time Dink grabbed it (but before he moved it).

"spriteoy": Returns a sprites Y position at the time Dink grabbed it (but before he moved it).

------------------------------------------

"move-axis": Returns which axis Dink is currently moving the sprite on. 
             Returns 1 or 2.
             1 = x axis   
	     2 = y axis

------------------------------------------

"move_after_idle": Used to make the “MoveDetectAfter” procedure only run if the sprite moved positions (If Dink grabbed it, and released without moving it, it won’t run)
                   0 = Run MoveDetectAfter always (even if sprite never moved)
                   1 = Only run MoveDetectAfter if sprite moved positions

"move_during_idle": Used to make the “MoveDetectDuring” procedure only run if the sprite is currently moving.
                    0 = Run MoveDetectDuring always (even if sprite isn’t moving)
                    1 = Only run MoveDetectDuring if sprite is currently moving

"move_idle": A combination of the above. Setting this to 1, is the same as setting both “move_after_idle” and “move_during_idle” to 1.

------------------------------------------

"MovePosNeg": Returns whether Dink is currently moving a sprite in a positive or negative direction. Constantly updated during moving the sprite.
              i.e: If sprite's co-ordinate is increasing while being moved, that's a positive direction, if it's decreasing, that’s a negative direction.
	      1 = Negative
	      2 = Positive

"PushPosNeg": Returns whether Dink will be pushing the sprite in a positive or negative direction. Set at the time Dink grabs the sprite.
	      1 = Negative
	      2 = Positive

	      1 = Negative
	      2 = Positive

	       	0 = Null (Dink has not initiated push or pull)    
	       	1 = Dink holding sprite but idle (e.g: reached hardness or sticky push idle). 
	       	2 = pushing. 
	       	3 = pulling.

 "last-status": This is similar to move-status, but ignores the IDLE value. If Dink becomes IDLE while moving a sprite, it will simply not update the value (the old value will be retained). It will also retain it's value after you release the sprite.
                Because of this, there are situations this can be useful. You can use it to check the last NON-IDLE move status on a sprite, when the "move-status" custom key returns 0 or 1. 
	        It only ignores the IDLE or NULL values, otherwise it'll update a push or pull result at the same time as move-status.
	        You'll notice value '1' is missing - this custom key will never store the value 1, I left it this way to make the values consistent with "move-status".
	        0 = Null(No prior status) 
		2 = pushing. 
		3 = pulling.

------------------------------------------

"move-dinkx": Returns Dink's last X position BEFORE the sprite was last moved (Stored/updated only when Dink grabs the sprite)

"move-dinky": Returns Dink's last Y position BEFORE the sprite was last moved (Stored/updated only when Dink grabs the sprite)

"move-sprx": Returns the sprite's last X position BEFORE it was last moved (Stored/updated only when Dink grabs the sprite)

	     Makes it look more aesthetically pleasing because he won't be walking through things.
	     This is set accurately at the back of his feet on both the x and y axis.

"PPTrackerPhisLimit#": Used to store tracker sprite's X or Y position before the collision test is conducted to later check if hardness has been found.
		     Used to detect PUSH limit
                     (# ranges from 1 - 7 inclusive). 

"PPTrackerPhisLimit#-ret": Used to store the first detected hardness in the tracker sprite's path when PUSHING, along the intended move axis, during collision calculation.
                         (# ranges from 1 - 7 inclusive).

"PPTracker#": Used to store the active sprite number of the tracker sprites created to detect hardness for the hardbox collision system, when PULLING.
            (# ranges from 1 - 7 inclusive)

"PPTrackerLimit#": Used to store tracker sprite's X or Y position before the collision test is conducted to later check if hardness has been found.
		 Used to detect PULL limit
                 (# ranges from 1 - 7 inclusive). 

"PPTrackerLimit#-ret": Used to store the first detected hardness in the tracker sprite's path when PULLING, along the intended move axis, during collision calculation.
                     (# ranges from 1 - 7 inclusive). 

"PPTrackerPhisCounter": Used to count the created Tracker sprites during the creation loop, during the initiating phase of the collision system, when PUSHING.

"PPTrackerPhismax": Used to set a limit on the maximum allowed number of tracker sprites to be created along a sprite's hardbox edge during collision calculation, when PUSHING.

"PPTrackerCounter": Used to count the created Tracker sprites during the creation loop, during the initiating phase of the collision system, when PULLING.

"PPTrackermax": Used to set a limit on the maximum allowed number of tracker sprites to be created along a sprite's hardbox edge during collision calculation, when PULLING.

“PPdone”: Used to determine when tracker sprites have done their job.
